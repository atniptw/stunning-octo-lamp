# Project Brief: AI Workflow Orchestration Tool

## Executive Summary

A command-line tool that orchestrates AI assistants within structured workflows to automate software development tasks while preventing scope creep and maintaining quality standards.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenge
Developers using AI tools (Claude, Copilot, etc.) face two critical issues:
1. **Scope Creep**: AI assistants frequently diverge from intended tasks, requiring manual cleanup
2. **Context Loss**: Small, disconnected tasks lead to lost context and reduced productivity

### Impact
- Wasted time deleting off-track AI work
- Difficulty maintaining focus on design and architecture
- Inefficient context switching between AI interactions

## Solution Overview

An orchestration system with two primary workflows:

1. **Tech Lead Workflow**: Transforms vague requirements into AI-ready specifications
2. **Developer Workflow**: Executes well-defined tasks using AI within strict boundaries

## Target Users

### Primary Personas
- **Tech Leads**: Need to create clear, implementable stories from vague requirements
- **Developers**: Want to leverage AI for implementation without constant oversight

### Organization Types
- Solo developers and freelancers
- Small to large development teams
- Open source projects

## Core Value Propositions

1. **Controlled AI Execution**: Prevent AI from modifying unrelated code
2. **Workflow Automation**: Handle git operations, PR creation, and CI/CD fixes
3. **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing and validation at each step
4. **Context Preservation**: Maintain focus by handling entire workflows end-to-end

## Success Metrics

- 80%+ of workflows complete without manual AI cleanup
- 50%+ reduction in time from issue to merged PR
- Measurable decrease in context switching

## Technical Approach

- CLI-based interface for simplicity
- Integration with GitHub for issue and PR management
- Claude API for AI task execution
- State machine for workflow orchestration

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Tech Lead Workflow (MVP)
Create AI-optimized story specifications from vague requirements

### Phase 2: Developer Workflow
Implement stories with automated git operations and PR management

### Phase 3: Integration & Enhancement
Connect workflows, add multiple AI providers, expand integrations

## Key Differentiators

1. **AI-First Design**: Stories specifically structured for AI consumption
2. **Workflow Orchestration**: Not just AI assistance, but complete workflow automation
3. **Quality Gates**: Multiple validation points prevent bad code from progressing
4. **Bounded Execution**: Explicit file and scope restrictions for AI tasks

## Next Steps

1. Build Tech Lead workflow MVP
2. Validate story template with real-world examples
3. Implement basic Developer workflow
4. Iterate based on user feedback
