- [ ] Determine story type based on issue labels (user-story, task, bug)
- [ ] Preserve issue metadata (labels, assignee, milestone, created_at)
- [ ] Convert issue body to story description format

## Command to Create These Subissues

When GitHub API access is available, use:

```bash
# Create all subissues for issue #2
workflow create-subissues 2

# Then select "Convert all stories for a feature" 
# And specify feature: "6" (GitHub Issues Integration)
```

This will create 5 GitHub subissues under parent issue #2, making the GitHub Issues Integration feature fully trackable through GitHub's native issue system.

## Workflow Integration

After creating these subissues:

1. **Developers** work on individual GitHub subissues
2. **Progress tracking** happens in GitHub issues  
3. **Local workflow tools** can reference GitHub issue numbers
4. **PR creation** links back to GitHub issues
5. **Story completion** closes GitHub subissues

The local story files are no longer needed - GitHub becomes the single source of truth.
