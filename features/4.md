# Implement GitHub Actions Workflow

## Description

When a developer creates a pull request a GitHub Actions workflow should run quality checks to provide feedback and ensure the developer did not forget to run the checks themself.

Checks to run:

1. Does the app build?
1. Do all the tests pass?
1. Are code coverage requirements met?
1. Is the code formatted correctly based on defined prettier rules?
1. Does the code pass a lint check based on configured eslint rules?

The workflow should create a nice summary and make it easy to add a check in GitHub to require the workflow to pass before merge can happen.
