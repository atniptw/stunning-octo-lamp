## Description

 [TASK] Setup technical foundation for Implement GitHub Actions Workflow

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Implementation follows project patterns
- [x] Code is properly tested
- [x] Documentation is updated

## Tasks

- [ ] Implementation follows project patterns
- [ ] Code is properly tested
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] To be defined by developer
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All tasks completed
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No regressions

- [x] Create basic GitHub Actions workflow structure (rationale: establish foundation first)
- [x] Create `.github/workflows/quality-checks.yml` with basic job structure
- [x] Add checkout and Node.js setup steps
- [x] Verify workflow triggers on pull requests
- [x] Implement build and dependency installation (rationale: core build process before checks)
- [x] Add npm ci step with caching for faster builds
- [x] Add npm run build step to verify TypeScript compilation
- [x] Ensure proper error handling and clear failure messages
- [x] Add test execution and coverage reporting (rationale: testing infrastructure separate from formatting)
- [x] Implement npm test step in workflow
- [x] Add coverage collection with nyc or built-in coverage
- [x] Generate coverage reports as workflow artifacts
- [x] Implement code formatting and linting checks (rationale: style checks separate from functional tests)
- [x] Add prettier format checking step
- [x] Add eslint linting step
- [x] Configure both to show clear diff output on failures
- [x] Add coverage threshold validation (rationale: separate quality gate)
- [x] Create `scripts/coverage-check.js` to validate coverage thresholds
- [x] Add coverage threshold configuration to `package.json`
- [x] Integrate threshold check into workflow
- [x] Configure workflow reporting and status (rationale: final polish for usability)
- [x] Add workflow status badge to `README.md`
- [x] Create clear summary output for failed checks
- [x] Document workflow in README with setup instructions
- [x] Test workflow with intentional failures (rationale: verify error handling works)
- [x] Test each check type individually with failing code
- [x] Verify error messages are actionable and clear
- [x] Confirm branch protection integration works properly
## Definition of Done

- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] All tasks completed
