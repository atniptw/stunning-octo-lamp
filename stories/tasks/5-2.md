[USER STORY] Developer can create pull requests from CLI

  Feature: #5 GitHub Pull Request Integration
  Type: user-story

  Description

  As a developer using the AI Workflow tool, I want to create pull requests directly from the CLI so that I can submit my completed work for review without leaving my terminal workflow.

  When I complete a story's tasks, I should be able to run a simple command that creates a pull request with all the necessary information (title, description, linked issues) automatically populated from
  the story data. The tool should handle branch creation, commits, and PR submission through the GitHub API.

  Acceptance Criteria

  - User can create a PR with workflow create-pr <storyId> command
  - PR title is automatically generated from story title
  - PR description includes story details, completed tasks, and links to the feature
  - Command validates that current branch has commits ready to push
  - Error handling for missing GitHub token or invalid permissions
  - Success message shows PR URL for easy access
  - Command works with both real GitHub API and local mock mode

  Technical Specification

  Files to Modify

  - src/cli.ts - Add new create-pr command registration
  - src/commands/create-pr.ts - New command implementation
  - src/services/github.ts - Add createPullRequest() method
  - src/services/local-github.ts - Add mock PR creation for testing

  Files NOT to Touch

  - src/services/analysis.ts - Analysis logic is separate concern
  - src/types/story.ts - No new types needed for basic PR creation
  - Configuration files - No config changes required

  Implementation Notes

  1. Follow pattern from src/commands/update-task.ts for loading story data
  2. Use Octokit client pattern from src/services/github.ts for API calls
  3. Generate PR body using markdown template similar to story display in src/commands/show-story.ts
  4. Check for GITHUB_TOKEN env var and provide clear error if missing
  5. Use ora spinner during PR creation like other commands
  6. Color output with chalk - green for success, red for errors

  Test Cases

  1. Given a completed story with tasks, when running workflow create-pr 4-1, then creates PR with story details and shows GitHub URL
  2. Given no GitHub token in env, when running workflow create-pr 4-1, then shows error "GitHub token required. Set GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable"
  3. Given uncommitted changes, when running workflow create-pr 4-1, then shows warning about uncommitted work
  4. Given local mock mode, when running workflow create-pr 4-1, then creates PR markdown file in .github/pulls/ directory
  5. Given story not found, when running workflow create-pr invalid-id, then shows error and lists available stories

  Definition of Done

  - Command creates PRs successfully in both GitHub and local mock modes
  - PR description includes all story context and completed tasks
  - All tests pass including new test coverage for PR creation
  - Code follows project patterns (async/await, error handling, CLI output)
  - No console errors or unhandled promise rejections
  - Documentation updated in README.md with new command usage
