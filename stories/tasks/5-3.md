 [TASK] Add tests for GitHub Pull Request Integration

  Feature: #5 GitHub Pull Request Integration
  Type: task

  Description

  Create comprehensive test suite for GitHub Pull Request Integration functionality to ensure reliable PR operations and prevent regressions. This includes unit tests for service methods, integration
  tests for CLI commands, and mock implementations for testing without GitHub API access.

  This testing infrastructure is critical to ensure the PR integration works correctly across different scenarios (authenticated, unauthenticated, network failures) and maintains compatibility as we add
  features like status checks and PR merging.

  Acceptance Criteria

  - Unit tests cover all GitHub service methods with 90%+ coverage
  - Integration tests verify CLI commands work end-to-end
  - Mock GitHub API responses for offline testing
  - Error scenarios are properly tested (auth failures, network issues, invalid data)
  - Tests run in CI pipeline without requiring real GitHub tokens

  Technical Specification

  Files to Modify

  - src/services/__tests__/github.test.ts - New unit tests for GitHubService class
  - src/services/__tests__/local-github.test.ts - Update tests for PR mock functionality
  - src/commands/__tests__/create-pr.test.ts - New integration tests for create-pr command
  - vitest.config.ts - Add test environment setup for GitHub API mocking
  - src/test-utils/github-mocks.ts - New file with reusable GitHub API mock responses

  Files NOT to Touch

  - src/services/github.ts - Only test the existing implementation
  - .github/workflows/ - CI configuration remains unchanged
  - Production command files - Tests should not modify implementation

  Implementation Notes

  1. Use Vitest's vi.mock() to mock Octokit client following pattern in existing test files
  2. Create factory functions for test data (PRs, commits, status checks) in test-utils/
  3. Test both success and failure paths for each method
  4. Mock file system operations for LocalGitHubService using vi.mock('fs/promises')
  5. Use beforeEach to reset mocks and create fresh service instances
  6. Group related tests using describe blocks like "GitHubService.createPullRequest"

  Test Cases

  1. Given valid GitHub token and story data, when creating PR via service, then returns PR object with number and URL
  2. Given invalid/expired GitHub token, when creating PR, then throws error with message "Bad credentials"
  3. Given network timeout, when calling GitHub API, then retries 3 times before failing
  4. Given local mock mode, when creating PR, then writes PR data to .github/pulls/[number].json
  5. Given PR creation response, when formatting for CLI output, then displays title, number, and URL
  6. Given missing required fields (title/base/head), when creating PR, then throws validation error
  7. Given branch with no commits, when creating PR, then shows helpful error message

  Definition of Done

  - All new tests pass locally and in CI
  - Test coverage for PR-related code exceeds 90%
  - Mock implementations allow offline development
  - Tests complete in under 10 seconds
  - No hardcoded test data - use factories/builders
  - Error messages in tests match actual GitHub API responses
  - Code follows Vitest patterns from existing test files
